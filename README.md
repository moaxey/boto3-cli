Simple CLI interface for Amazon AWS services
============================================

This is an ultra-simple exercise, exposing the [boto3 API interface](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as a command line interface using python-fire.

While it covers the entire API, it is not heavily used at this time.

It uses config stored as per boto3 documentation, in ~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials
